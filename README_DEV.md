## Key Features Added

### Frontend Changes
- **Search Page**: Now fetches only approved vehicles and shows "No cars listed" message
- **Admin Dashboard**: Simple approve/reject actions for pending vehicles
- **Auth Hook**: Token-based authentication with API integration

### Database Schema
- **Users**: UUID primary key, role-based access (RENTER/HOST/ADMIN)
- **Vehicles**: Auto-increment ID, owner relationship, status (PENDING/APPROVED/REJECTED)

- **Bookings**: Transaction-based booking with conflict prevention
