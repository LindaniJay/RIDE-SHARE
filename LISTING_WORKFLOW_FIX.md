/**
 * Vehicle Listing Workflow Fix
 * 
 * This document outlines the fixes applied to resolve issues in the vehicle listing workflow
 * and provides a comprehensive solution for the debugging process.
 */

// 1. BACKEND SERVER STARTUP ISSUES
// ================================

// Issue: Backend server failing to start due to database migration errors
// Fix: Reset database and ensure proper initialization

const databaseFix = {
  issue: "SQLite database migration errors preventing server startup",
  solution: "Remove existing database.sqlite file and let Sequelize recreate it",
  steps: [
    "1. Delete backend/database.sqlite",
    "2. Start backend server with fresh database",
    "3. Verify all models sync properly"
  ]
};

// 2. FRONTEND COMPONENT ISSUES
// ============================

// Issue: TypeScript compilation errors in vehicle listing components
// Fix: Update component interfaces and fix type mismatches

const frontendFixes = {
  issues: [
    "Missing props in GlassButton, GlassInput, Icon components",
    "Type mismatches in user.id (string vs number)",
    "Unused imports causing linter warnings",
    "Missing onChange handlers for form inputs"
  ],
  solutions: [
    "Added missing props to component interfaces",
    "Fixed type conversions with parseInt()",
    "Removed unused imports and declarations",
    "Added proper event handlers for form inputs"
  ]
};

// 3. API INTEGRATION ISSUES
// =========================

// Issue: Frontend-backend communication problems
// Fix: Ensure proper API endpoints and authentication

const apiFixes = {
  endpoints: {
    vehicleSubmission: "POST /api/enhanced-vehicles",
    imageUpload: "POST /api/enhanced-vehicles/:id/images",
    adminApproval: "PATCH /api/admin/vehicles/:id/approve",
    healthCheck: "GET /api/health"
  },
  authentication: {
    required: true,
    header: "Authorization: Bearer <token>",
    middleware: "authenticateToken"
  }
};

// 4. WORKFLOW IMPROVEMENTS
// ========================

const workflowImprovements = {
  submission: {
    steps: [
      "1. User fills out vehicle listing form",
      "2. Images are uploaded to server",
      "3. Form data is submitted to backend",
      "4. Vehicle is created with 'pending' status",
      "5. Admin receives notification"
    ],
    validation: [
      "Required fields validation",
      "Image upload validation",
      "Document upload validation",
      "Location validation"
    ]
  },
  approval: {
    steps: [
      "1. Admin reviews pending vehicles",
      "2. Admin approves or rejects listing",
      "3. Host receives notification",
      "4. Vehicle status updated",
      "5. Approved vehicles become searchable"
    ],
    notifications: [
      "Email notification to host",
      "In-app notification",
      "Status update in dashboard"
    ]
  }
};

// 5. TESTING STRATEGY
// ===================

const testingStrategy = {
  unitTests: [
    "Component rendering tests",
    "Form validation tests",
    "API endpoint tests",
    "Authentication tests"
  ],
  integrationTests: [
    "Complete listing submission flow",
    "Image upload process",
    "Admin approval workflow",
    "Frontend-backend communication"
  ],
  e2eTests: [
    "User registration and login",
    "Vehicle listing creation",
    "Admin approval process",
    "Search and booking flow"
  ]
};

// 6. DEBUGGING TOOLS
// ==================

const debuggingTools = {
  backend: [
    "Health check endpoint: /api/health",
    "Test endpoint: /api/test",
    "Database connection verification",
    "Logging with Winston"
  ],
  frontend: [
    "React DevTools",
    "Network tab for API calls",
    "Console logging",
    "Error boundaries"
  ],
  monitoring: [
    "Server logs",
    "Database queries",
    "API response times",
    "Error tracking"
  ]
};

// 7. COMMON ISSUES AND SOLUTIONS
// =============================

const commonIssues = {
  "Backend not responding": {
    cause: "Server not started or database issues",
    solution: "Check server logs, restart backend, verify database"
  },
  "CORS errors": {
    cause: "Frontend-backend URL mismatch",
    solution: "Update CORS configuration in backend"
  },
  "Authentication failures": {
    cause: "Invalid or expired tokens",
    solution: "Check token generation and validation"
  },
  "Image upload failures": {
    cause: "File size limits or upload directory issues",
    solution: "Check multer configuration and file permissions"
  },
  "Database connection errors": {
    cause: "SQLite file corruption or migration issues",
    solution: "Delete database.sqlite and restart server"
  }
};

// 8. DEPLOYMENT CHECKLIST
// =======================

const deploymentChecklist = {
  backend: [
    "✅ Environment variables configured",
    "✅ Database migrations completed",
    "✅ File upload directories created",
    "✅ CORS settings updated",
    "✅ Authentication middleware working",
