# ⚠️ Supabase Connection Issue

## Problem

The connection string format you found is correct, but DNS resolution is failing for:
`db.jmntfhcjvxlyxlyipgvk.supabase.co`

## Possible Causes:

1. **Project Still Provisioning:** Supabase projects can take 2-3 minutes to fully provision. The database hostname might not be active yet.

2. **Different Connection Format Needed:** Supabase might use a connection pooler URL instead of direct connection for some projects.

## Solutions:

### Solution 1: Wait and Retry

If your project was just created:
1. Wait 2-3 minutes
2. Then try again:
   ```bash
   npm run setup:supabase:tables
   ```

### Solution 2: Check Project Status

1. Go to: https://app.supabase.com/project/jmntfhcjvxlyxlyipgvk
2. Check if there's a "Provisioning" or "Setting up" status
3. Wait until the project shows as "Active"

### Solution 3: Use Connection Pooler

Try using the connection pooler format instead. You'll need your project's region:

1. Go to: https://app.supabase.com/project/jmntfhcjvxlyxlyipgvk/settings/general
2. Find your **Region** (e.g., `sa-east-1`, `us-east-1`)
3. Update `.env` with:
   ```env
   DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres.jmntfhcjvxlyxlyipgvk:0692151207%40Lj@aws-0-[YOUR-REGION].pooler.supabase.com:5432/postgres
   ```

### Solution 4: Check Supabase Dashboard

1. In Supabase Dashboard, try using the SQL Editor:
   - Go to: https://app.supabase.com/project/jmntfhcjvxlyxlyipgvk/editor
   - Click "SQL Editor"
   - If you can run queries there, the database is active

## Next Steps:

1. **Check if your project is fully provisioned**
2. **Get your region from Settings → General**
3. **Try the pooler connection format with your region**

Let me know:
- Is your project showing as "Active" or still "Provisioning"?
- What region is shown in Settings → General?
