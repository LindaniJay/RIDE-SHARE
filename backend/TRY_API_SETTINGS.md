# 🔄 Alternative: Check API Settings

## The Connection String Might Be in API Settings Instead!

### Step 1: Go to API Settings

1. **Click on "Settings"** (⚙️ icon) in the left sidebar (at the top level, not under Database)
2. **Click on "API"** 
3. Or go directly: https://app.supabase.com/project/jmntfhcjvxlyxlyipgvk/settings/api

### Step 2: Look for Database Connection

On the API Settings page, look for:
- **"Database URL"** section
- **"Connection string"** section
- **"PostgreSQL connection"** section

The connection string might be there!

### Step 3: While You're There

You'll also see:
- Project URL (you already have this: `https://jmntfhcjvxlyxlyipgvk.supabase.co`)
- anon/public key (you have this)
- service_role key (you have this)

Scroll down to see if there's database connection info.
