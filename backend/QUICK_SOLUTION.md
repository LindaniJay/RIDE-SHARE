# 🚀 Quick Solution: Let's Construct It!

## Since we can't find the connection string, let's build it!

### What We Know:
- ✅ Project: `jmntfhcjvxlyxlyipgvk`
- ✅ Password: `0692151207@Lj` 
- ✅ URL-encoded password: `0692151207%40Lj`

### What We Need:
- ❓ Your project's **region**

### Get Your Region:

1. **Go to:** https://app.supabase.com/project/jmntfhcjvxlyxlyipgvk/settings/general
2. **Look for:** "Region" field
3. **Common regions:**
   - `sa-east-1` (South America - São Paulo)
   - `us-east-1` (US East)
   - `eu-west-1` (Europe - Ireland)
   - `ap-southeast-1` (Asia Pacific)

### Once You Tell Me the Region:

I'll give you the **exact connection string** to put in your `.env` file!

### Or Try This Common Format:

If your region is **sa-east-1** (South America), try this in your `.env`:

```env
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres.jmntfhcjvxlyxlyipgvk:0692151207%40Lj@aws-0-sa-east-1.pooler.supabase.com:5432/postgres
```

Then test:
```bash
npm run db:test
```

If that doesn't work, tell me what region you see in Settings → General!
