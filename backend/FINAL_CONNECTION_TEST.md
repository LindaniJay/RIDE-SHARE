# 🔍 Final Connection Test - Let's Find the Exact Format

## Since SQL Editor is Working

Your database IS accessible (since SQL Editor works). We just need the correct connection string format.

## Option 1: Get Exact Connection String from Dashboard

On the Database Settings page where you found the connection string format, is there a **"Copy"** button or an actual connection string shown (not just the template)?

Look for:
- A button that says "Copy connection string"
- A field with an actual connection string (not `[YOUR_PASSWORD]`)
- Something that shows the full connection string

If you see a full connection string, copy that exactly.

## Option 2: Check Connection Pooling Section

On the Database Settings page:
1. Look for **"Connection pooling"** section
2. There might be different connection strings there
3. Try the ones under "Transaction mode" or "Session mode"

## Option 3: Manual Connection Test

Let's try the direct format but verify the hostname is correct. Can you:

1. In the Supabase Dashboard, go to SQL Editor
2. Try to see what connection details it shows
3. Or tell me what happens when you click "Copy connection string" if there's a button

## Option 4: Use Supabase Client Instead

Since the direct PostgreSQL connection isn't working, we could use Supabase's REST API through the client library, but that's more complex.

## What I Need:

1. **In Database Settings**, is there a **"Copy"** button next to the connection string?
2. **Does it show a complete connection string** or just the template with `[YOUR_PASSWORD]`?
3. **Can you try copying whatever connection string is shown** and share it here?

This will help us get the exact format your Supabase project uses.
