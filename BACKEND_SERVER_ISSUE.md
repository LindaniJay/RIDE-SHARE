# 🚨 Backend Server Issue - Fix Required

## ✅ Good News!

1. ✅ **Firebase Authentication is WORKING!**
   - User is authenticated successfully
   - Firestore is working correctly
   - User data is being retrieved
   - No more permission errors! 🎉

2. ✅ **Frontend is running on port 3000**
   - Vite dev server is running
   - Proxy is configured correctly

## ❌ Problem Found

**Backend server is NOT running on port 5001**

This is why you're seeing:
- `ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED` for `localhost:5001`
- 500 errors when calling `/api/admin/...` (proxy forwards to non-existent backend)

## 🔧 Solution

### Step 1: Start Backend Server

Open a **NEW terminal** and run:

```bash
cd backend
npm run dev
```

Or if you prefer:

```bash
cd backend
npm start
```

### Step 2: Verify Backend is Running

You should see output like:
```
🚀 RideShare.SA Server running on http://localhost:5001
📱 Environment: development
🔗 Frontend URLs: http://localhost:3000,http://localhost:5173
```

### Step 3: Check Frontend Again

After backend starts:
1. Go back to your browser
2. Hard refresh: `Ctrl + Shift + R`
3. Admin dashboard should work now!

## 📊 Current Status

| Component | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Firebase Auth | ✅ Working | User authenticated successfully |
| Firestore | ✅ Working | User data retrieved successfully |
| Frontend Dev Server | ✅ Running | Port 3000 |
| **Backend Server** | ❌ **NOT Running** | **Need to start it!** |

## 🎯 Quick Fix

**Just run this in a new terminal:**

```bash
cd backend && npm run dev
```

Then refresh your browser!

## 📝 After Backend Starts

Once the backend is running, you should see:
- ✅ Admin dashboard loads successfully
- ✅ Admin stats endpoint works (`/api/admin/dashboard-stats`)
- ✅ All API calls succeed
- ✅ No more 500 errors
- ✅ No more connection refused errors

---

**That's it!** The backend just needs to be started. Everything else is working perfectly! 🚀
